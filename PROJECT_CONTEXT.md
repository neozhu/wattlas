# Palantir - My Ver

## Status

The Europe-first working vertical slice and the global Wattlas map were implemented on 2026-06-27. Global facility coverage was expanded the same day using community-maintained OpenStreetMap infrastructure merged with curated official project evidence. Global ADM1 state/province intelligence, the declared Government of India boundary perspective, and richer facility inspection were implemented on 2026-06-28.

## Origin

The project is inspired by Bilawal Sidhu's browser-based WorldView / “God's Eye View” geospatial command center:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HEUCLc7aL8&t=312s
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccZzOGnT4Cg&t=810s
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p8o7AeHDzg
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXvU7bPJ8n4&t=124s

The inspiration includes a cinematic 3D globe, time-based playback, multiple public-data layers, evidence-backed event tracking, tactical visual modes, and public OSINT fusion. The goal is not to clone every military/OSINT feature. The product has been deliberately narrowed to a differentiated energy-intelligence use case.

## Validated product direction

Build a Europe-first, browser-based **energy and data-center infrastructure Opportunity Radar** using public data.

The product should answer:

> Where will European data-center growth create the largest energy-infrastructure demand, opportunity, or constraint over the next five years?

The long-term product should combine:

1. A useful public analytical platform.
2. A cinematic WorldView-style presentation and briefing mode.

The first version should be a private working instrument. It may later become public after verification.

### Approved global expansion

The original Europe-first scope remains the validated foundation and historical first release. The next release expands the Opportunity Radar globally while preserving the 2026–2031 horizon, public-data-only boundary, Infrastructure Demand primary score, and Site Attractiveness/System Risk supporting lenses.

- **Product name:** Wattlas.
- **Audience:** both infrastructure professionals (investors, developers, utilities, and energy planners) and an interested general public.
- **Geography:** global country coverage with thick national boundaries; progressively reveal subnational boundaries and scores where reliable public data exists.
- **Boundary policy:** use UN national geometry generally, geoBoundaries `gbOpen` ADM1 state/province geometry, and GISCO NUTS-2 for deeper European detail. India is the approved exception: its national and state/union-territory geometry uses the declared **Government of India perspective**, with explicit attribution rather than silently adjudicating disputed claims.
- **Infrastructure:** combine data centres and water infrastructure in one electrical-demand model, with toggles that isolate each category.
- **Water scope:** desalination, wastewater treatment, water reuse, electrically material pipelines/pumping, and reservoirs. Only documented or estimated electrical consumption contributes to demand; hydropower and passive storage remain supply/context layers.
- **Asset timing:** upcoming 2026–2031 projects drive the score; existing assets provide context.
- **Location precision:** use exact coordinates when officially public; otherwise show a labelled city or regional centroid. Never fabricate precision.
- **Subnational priority:** ingest every reliable region available, initially prioritizing Europe, the United States and Canada, China, India, Gulf markets, and major Asia-Pacific economies. Use clearly labelled inherited national estimates where regional data is absent.
- **Downloads:** map viewing and evidence inspection only in this release; no CSV export.
- **Publishing:** complete a local, GitHub/Vercel-ready build first. Repository creation and production deployment follow separately.

The approved global design is recorded in `docs/plans/2026-06-27-wattlas-global-expansion-design.md`.

### Approved global state power-balance expansion

The next approved release turns Wattlas into an evidence-first global ADM1 electricity-balance atlas while preserving every earlier product decision.

- **Regional visibility:** show first-order state/province-equivalent borders faintly from the world view, strengthen them with zoom, add labels at medium zoom, and retain deeper layers such as European NUTS-2 at closer zoom.
- **Regional population:** use official ADM1 population first and WorldPop Global2 estimates otherwise, with source year, confidence, and observed/estimated labels.
- **Power generation:** add utility-scale operating, construction, and planned plants as a third infrastructure category; exclude household and rooftop generators.
- **Generator technologies:** use individual colours for solar, wind, hydropower, nuclear, gas, coal, oil, biomass, geothermal, and other, reinforced by marker shape or outline.
- **Hybrid electricity balance:** use official ADM1 demand, generation, interchange, and shortage data where available; otherwise publish controlled low/base/high estimates tied to national totals and public spatial covariates.
- **Deficit terminology:** keep local generation gap, net balance, and officially observed unmet demand separate. Never call demand minus local generation a definitive shortage when imports are unknown.
- **Time:** show the latest actual data plus 2026–2031 demand, supply, capacity, and balance projections.
- **Power Balance lens:** add a fourth explainable analytical lens while retaining Infrastructure Demand as primary and Site Attractiveness/System Risk as supporting lenses.
- **Attribution:** add the subtle persistent line `Created by Aditya Gupta · Open-source project`, linking to the GitHub repository.
- **Quality posture:** every regional result exposes source, date, method, confidence, coverage, and value kind; unavailable data remains unavailable rather than zero.

The approved design is recorded in `docs/plans/2026-06-28-global-state-power-balance-design.md`.

## Decisions already approved

- **Initial user:** the project owner, who works at Siemens Energy.
- **Data boundary:** public data only for the first version. Authorized internal data may be connected later through separate, secure connectors.
- **Geography:** Europe first, while keeping the visual shell capable of becoming global.
- **Time horizon:** prioritize long-term opportunity over near-term operations, approximately 2026–2031 / one to five years.
- **Weather:** use weather and climate as a stress-test/context layer, not the primary product identity. Examples include heat-driven demand, cooling constraints, drought/water stress, and renewable-generation conditions.
- **Lead experience:** Opportunity Radar.
- **Primary score:** Energy Infrastructure Demand.
- **Supporting lenses:** Data-Center Site Attractiveness and Energy-System Risk.
- **Public-product posture:** vendor-neutral analytical language even though the private prototype is strategically relevant to Siemens Energy.
- **Scoring principle:** avoid a magical opaque number. Every score must expose its drivers, confidence, evidence, dates, and source provenance.
- **Refresh model:** run an incremental public-data update once per month, retain immutable snapshots, and keep serving the last successful snapshot if a connector fails; manual dispatch remains available.
- **Freshness language:** say **monthly refreshed**, not “live”; show global and per-source timestamps and connector states.
- **Primary map experience:** a fast 2D Europe analytical canvas with progressive zoom, persistent regional inspection, and comparison. Preserve the 3D globe for later Cinematic Briefing mode.

### Approved July 2026 map and demand-intelligence evolution

The fast 2D Europe canvas remains the historical foundation, but the current approved global release supersedes its presentation at world scale with a restrained, light physical-geography globe. This is an analytical globe—not a cinematic effects mode—and it retains the same progressive subnational inspection.

- **Map presentation:** use a white/light basemap with modest rivers, water, terrain, and forest context; render facilities as smaller points; make renewable technologies brighter and fossil technologies darker; preserve strong national and progressive ADM1 boundaries.
- **Experience architecture:** Opportunity Radar remains the lead experience. Asset Explorer is a second top-level mode. Country Intelligence is a drill-down from a selected country, not a competing third homepage mode.
- **Status filters:** publish the five planning-relevant groups Operating, Under construction, Pre-construction, Announced, and Retired. Preserve raw source status in each dossier and keep excluded statuses in pipeline governance.
- **Project inspection:** selecting a point opens a compact, source-backed summary before the existing detailed right-side dossier. Reported facts and modelled values must remain visually distinct.
- **Country Intelligence:** summarize current demand and generation, forecast additions, retirements, technology mix, 2026–2031 outlook, confidence, and source lineage from published ADM1 rows. Never synthesize missing country or regional values inside the UI.
- **Industrial demand:** ingest the downloaded IEA June 2026 hydrogen-production and infrastructure releases, GEM June 2026 iron/steel release, and GEM July 2025 cement/concrete release through checksum-verified governed snapshots under CC BY 4.0.
- **Demand formulas:** use versioned low/central/high annual-energy methods for eligible hydrogen production, electric steel, and cement projects. Keep raw input, source-record identity, formula, method version, and result together.
- **Network exclusion:** hydrogen pipelines, storage, blending, and terminals are context-only and never generate a demand increment by themselves.
- **Forecast gates:** an industrial project affects 2026–2031 only with a publishable source, valid ADM1 assignment, supported commissioning year, eligible lifecycle, non-negative demand range, and versioned method ID.
- **Additive data rule:** retain all existing data-centre, water, generator, geography, and baseline-demand data. New industrial assets and increments are additions, not replacements.
- **ENTSO-E:** read the future Transparency Platform token from `ENTSOE_SECURITY_TOKEN`; until configured, expose `not_configured` and use the existing governed fallback. Never embed or commit the token.
- **Publication gate:** build and host this redesign locally for the owner to test. Do not push to GitHub or deploy to Vercel until explicit approval after review.

The approved design and execution plan are recorded in:

## Product approaches considered

### A. Opportunity Radar — selected

Rank regions and announced projects using compute-capacity growth, grid headroom, connection scarcity, generation and storage pipelines, cooling conditions, infrastructure gaps, and evidence confidence.

### B. Scenario Laboratory — future capability

Let users vary data-center growth, weather, generation, and grid assumptions to explore supply-demand gaps through 2030.

### C. Cinematic Briefing — future public/presentation mode

Turn verified data into guided stories that move through regions, projects, constraints, timelines, and implications on the 3D globe.

Recommended sequence: build A first, design the data model so B is possible, then add C as the polished public-facing mode.

## Approved core experience

The core screen and interaction loop were approved:

1. Scan ranked European opportunity hotspots on a globe/map.
2. Switch among Infrastructure Demand, Site Attractiveness, and System Risk lenses.
3. Select a region or project.
4. Inspect a transparent score breakdown and the factors driving it.
5. Review confidence, source count, dates, provenance, and evidence.
6. Open a deeper evidence dossier.
7. Watch a region or create a cinematic briefing.

The selected-region panel should explain likely needs such as substations, transformers, flexible generation, storage, grid reinforcement, cooling, and related energy infrastructure without turning the public product into a company-specific sales tool.

## Early public-data findings

- ENTSO-E Transparency Platform: operational load, generation, transmission, and market-related grid data.
- ENTSO-E / DSO Entity Capacitypedia: a pan-European overview of available grid-hosting-capacity information, launched in May 2026.
- Copernicus / ECMWF ERA5 and related products: weather and climate variables, including temperature, wind, solar-related conditions, drought, and historical stress analysis.
- EU data-center energy-performance reporting: useful public aggregated statistics at Member State and Union level.
- EU Delegated Regulation 2024/1364: reporting applies to qualifying data centres, but public outputs are primarily aggregated.
- Eurostat and national datasets: regional energy, economic, demographic, building, and industrial context.
- Individual planned data-center sites are the difficult layer. They will require a curated pipeline from planning applications, company announcements, operator publications, and credible reporting. Every site record needs lifecycle status and evidence confidence.

- `design/brand-spec.md`
- `product-facts.md`

The implementation plan is recorded in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-27-opportunity-radar-working-version.md`.

The working version now includes:

- A Next.js 16 / React 19 analytical shell using the approved Huashu visual system.
- A clustered global MapLibre map with 246 countries, 3,229 geoBoundaries ADM1 states/provinces across 197 countries, all 334 GISCO NUTS-2 regions, and thick national boundaries.
- A production WorldPop population layer for 3,204 ADM1 geographies, using the checksum-pinned 2025 R2025A v1 global 1 km raster plus official 100 m country fallbacks only for primary gaps. Twenty-five unsupported geographies remain explicitly unavailable.
- Country-level-only electricity handling for 11 affected countries: all 155 ADM1 boundaries remain selectable, national controls remain visible where available, and no regional shares, demand, or Power Balance ranks are fabricated.
- Production snapshot `2026-07-01T15-55-32Z` with 4,325 demand facilities (4,224 data centres and 101 water-infrastructure assets), 53,252 deduplicated power generators, and 3,185 published ADM1 energy series. Of 3,030 modelled ADM1 regions, 1,895 are Power Balance-rankable; 155 additional country-level-only regions stay explicitly unavailable.
- Country electricity controls from Ember's checksum-pinned 2026-06-23 public Yearly Electricity Data release: 5,388 annual records across 214 countries/economies, with source observations through 2025.
- A zoom hierarchy that keeps national borders strongest, reveals global ADM1 boundaries at medium zoom, and reveals European NUTS-2 boundaries closer in.
- The Government of India perspective for India, validated to include all 36 states/union territories and specifically Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh.
- QLever/OpenStreetMap ingestion with ODbL attribution, stable source links, community/official provenance, lifecycle, operator, and location-precision labels.
- Individual facility inspection grouped into Identity, Location, Operations, Energy, and Sources, with owner/operator, public address tags, references, dates, reported power, external IDs, precise coordinates, provenance, and honest unavailable states.
- Country, ADM1, and NUTS-2 summaries split by operational/planned, category, and official/community source.
- 2026–2031 Infrastructure Demand, Site Attractiveness, and System Risk views.
- Explicit score arithmetic, confidence, coverage, value kind, evidence dossiers, source state, and comparison.
- A Python 3.13 / DuckDB snapshot pipeline using UN Geodata, QLever/OpenStreetMap, GISCO, Eurostat, curated public evidence, and an optional ENTSO-E connector.
- Immutable published GeoJSON/JSON snapshots and a last-known-good connector fallback.
- A monthly refresh at 04:00 Europe/Berlin on the first day of each month.
- A GitHub Actions refresh at the same Berlin-local time, with manual dispatch available at any time.
- Local candidate snapshot `2026-07-21T04-01-18Z`, which retains the preceding 4,247 data centres, 101 water assets, 238,395 power-source records, 3,229 ADM1 boundaries, 575 cities, and 60,600 grid features while adding 7,694 mappable industrial-load assets, 27 mappable hydrogen-network context assets, and 236 forecast-eligible industrial projects.

Production is Git-connected at `https://wattlas.vercel.app`. The monthly pipeline keeps the version-pinned boundary artifact separate from frequently changing facility data, rejects partial OSM responses below the coverage threshold, retains the last known good capture on failure, and commits validated snapshot changes. Expansion sources use four governed access modes: automatically published reusable public endpoints, credential-backed connectors, checksum-verified manual snapshots, and a physically separate quarantine for unclear redistribution rights. Quarantined records cannot affect public scores or appear on the map.
